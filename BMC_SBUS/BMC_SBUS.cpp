/*
BMC_SBUS version 0.1.0 May 14th 2016 Stu Aitken
A simplified library for writing out serial servo data in Futaba SBUS format 

explictly written to control Blackmagic Design micro cameras, but shoud work generally

note for RC use various important flags such as failsafe have been omiited here
please refer to original source Libray in this case

based on FUTABA_SBUS library written by Michael Baker
